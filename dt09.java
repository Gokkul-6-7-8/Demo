//The program must accept an integer array of size N and an integer K as the input. 
//The program must print the output based on the following conditions.
//Input: 9 39 23 19 27 41 55 69 88 97 4 
//Output: YES 
//Explanation: The 9 integers are 39 23 19 27 41 55 69 88 97. 
//After sorting the first 4 integers in ascending order, the integers become 19 23 27 39 41 55 69 88 97. 
//Now, all the 9 integers are in ascending order. So YES is printed
